# CacheRepositoryBlog
This example is based on the very helpful blog post from Rahul Nath @ http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/using-repository-pattern-for-abstracting-data-access-from-a-cache-and-data-store/

He kindly provided a version of his source code which I have taken and tried to apply to a small real world solution. https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/RepositoryPattern
